# Whitelist Decentralised Application

The Whitelist project consists of a smart contract written in Solidity and a frontend application that interacts with the smart contract.

## Smart Contract - Whitelist

The Whitelist smart contract manages a list of whitelisted addresses. It allows adding addresses to the whitelist up to a specified maximum limit.

## Frontend Application

The frontend application provides a user interface for interacting with the Whitelist smart contract. It allows users to view the list of whitelisted addresses and add new addresses to the whitelist.

## Technologies Used

The Whitelist project utilizes the following technologies:

### Smart Contract

- Solidity: The programming language used for writing the smart contract.
- Ethereum: The blockchain platform on which the smart contract is deployed.

### Frontend

- Ether.js: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: A framework for building server-rendered React applications.

## How to Use

1. Deploy the Whitelist smart contract and provide the necessary configuration parameters (e.g., maximum number of whitelisted addresses).
2. Start the frontend application locally or deploy it to a web server.
3. Interact with the frontend application to view the list of whitelisted addresses and add new addresses to the whitelist.
